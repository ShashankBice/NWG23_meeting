    This is an informal event, but we do ask for everyone to fill out the registration form (red button on top right corner of the webpage) so that we know how many people are coming and can plan the meeting agenda. 
    </br></br>
    Please email <a href="nwg2023seattle@gmail.com">us</a> if you have any questions.
    </br></br>
    Oral presentation time slots will be 15 minutes, so please prepare a talk no longer than 12 minutes to allow for 3 minutes of questions and changeover to the next speaker.
    </br></br>
    There will also be a poster session and posters that fit within size guidelines of other meetings can be accommodated on the walls of our meeting room or in the hallway. 
    </br></br>
    If you indicated interest in a presentation and specified that it would be a poster or it would be an oral, please proceed with preparing your presentation. If you indicated either poster or oral we will get back to you soon to confirm.
    </br></br>
    If you would like to present and need to fill out the registration form, do that now!
